# Balatro WoF Analyzer - A Balatro bot to prove that LocalThunk is a troll

Made with [Balatrobot](https://github.com/besteon/balatrobot), but I had to modify and add some stuff so I included it aswell in this repo.

## Installation / Usage

Requires Steamodded, put bot in the mods folder and run bot_WoF_Tester.py
